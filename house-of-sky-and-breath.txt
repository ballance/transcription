 I'm asking you, Roon, to pick up where you Sophie left off. How long you decide to work with us is up to you, but right now, Ophien is desperate for day-bright's information. People's lives depend on it. Day-bright has alerted us three times now before an imperial attack on our bases. These warnings saved thousands of lives. We need you for the next few months, or at least until we've attained the intel that Sophie knew.
